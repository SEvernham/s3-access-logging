# S3 Access Logging Solution - CloudFormation Deployment

A comprehensive AWS CloudFormation solution that provides detailed S3 bucket access logging with real-time processing and long-term archival. This solution captures all S3 operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with detailed information about who accessed what, when, and how.

## üéØ Purpose

This CloudFormation template creates a complete logging infrastructure to monitor and audit S3 bucket access patterns. It's designed for organizations that need:

- **Security Auditing**: Track who is accessing your S3 data
- **Compliance Requirements**: Maintain detailed access logs for regulatory purposes
- **Operational Monitoring**: Understand usage patterns and detect anomalies
- **Incident Response**: Investigate security events with detailed forensic data

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The solution creates an integrated logging pipeline:

```
S3 Operations ‚Üí CloudTrail ‚Üí S3 Notification ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí CloudWatch Logs + Weekly Archives
```

### Components Created

1. **CloudTrail Trail** - Captures S3 API calls using Advanced Event Selectors
2. **S3 CloudTrail Bucket** - Stores raw CloudTrail logs with automatic cleanup
3. **Lambda Function** - Processes CloudTrail logs and formats events
4. **CloudWatch Log Group** - Stores formatted, searchable logs
5. **S3 Archive Bucket** - Stores weekly aggregated logs with statistics
6. **IAM Roles & Policies** - Secure permissions for all components
7. **S3 Notifications** - Triggers Lambda when new CloudTrail logs arrive

## üìä What Gets Logged

### S3 Operations Captured
- **CREATE/UPDATE**: PutObject, CopyObject, RestoreObject
- **READ**: GetObject, ListBucket, GetBucketLocation
- **DELETE**: DeleteObject, DeleteBucket

### Information Collected

## üîç Querying Logs

### CloudWatch Logs Insights

Access via AWS Console ‚Üí CloudWatch ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Log groups ‚Üí `/aws/s3/your-bucket-name/access-logs`

**Example Queries:**

```sql
# Show all operations from the last hour
fields @timestamp, operation, who.user_name, what.key
| filter @timestamp > @timestamp - 1h
| sort @timestamp desc

# Filter by specific user
fields @timestamp, operation, what.key, response.error_code
| filter who.user_name = "john.doe"
| sort @timestamp desc

# Show only DELETE operations
fields @timestamp, who.user_name, what.key, response.error_code
| filter operation = "DELETE"
| sort @timestamp desc

# Count operations by user
stats count() by who.user_name
| sort count desc
```

### AWS CLI Access

```bash
# View recent logs
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name "/aws/s3/your-bucket-name/access-logs" \
  --start-time $(date -d "1 hour ago" +%s)000

# Filter for specific operations
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name "/aws/s3/your-bucket-name/access-logs" \
  --filter-pattern "DELETE" \
  --start-time $(date -d "1 hour ago" +%s)000
```

### Weekly Archives

```bash
# List all weekly archive files
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name-weekly-logs-123456789012/weekly-logs/

# Download specific week's archive
aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket-name-weekly-logs-123456789012/weekly-logs/2024-W25.json ./

# View archive with summary statistics
cat 2024-W25.json | jq '.summary'
```

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### Monthly Cost Breakdown (1,000 operations/day)

| Service | Component | Estimated Cost |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **CloudTrail** | Data events (30,000/month) | $3.00 |
| **Lambda** | Invocations + compute time | $0.50 |
| **CloudWatch Logs** | Ingestion (1GB) + Storage | $2.00 |
| **S3 (CloudTrail)** | Storage (5GB) + requests | $1.00 |
| **S3 (Archives)** | Storage (10GB) + requests | $1.50 |
| **Total** | | **~$8.00/month** |

### Cost by Usage Level

| Usage Level | Operations/Day | Monthly Cost |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Light | 100 | $2-4 |
| Moderate | 1,000 | $6-10 |
| Heavy | 10,000 | $25-40 |
| Enterprise | 100,000 | $200-350 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### No Logs Appearing

1. **Verify S3 operations**: Ensure you're performing data events (PutObject, GetObject, DeleteObject)
2. **Check CloudTrail status**: Verify trail is active and logging
3. **Wait for processing**: Data events take 15-20 minutes to appear
4. **Check Lambda logs**: Look for processing errors in CloudWatch

### High Costs

1. **Review data event volume**: CloudTrail data events are the primary cost driver
2. **Adjust retention periods**: Reduce CloudWatch log retention
3. **Monitor usage**: Use AWS Cost Explorer to track spending

### Permission Errors

1. **IAM acknowledgment**: Ensure you checked the IAM resources box during deployment
2. **Regional deployment**: Deploy in same region as your S3 bucket
3. **Resource conflicts**: Check for naming conflicts with existing resources

## üßπ Cleanup

To remove all resources and stop charges:

1. Go to CloudFormation console
2. Select your stack
3. Click **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

**Note**: S3 buckets with content may need manual emptying before stack deletion completes.

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Event Filtering

The solution can be extended to:
- Filter specific S3 operations using `eventName` field selectors
- Add custom alerting with SNS integration
- Extend retention policies for compliance requirements
- Add encryption for sensitive log data

### Integration Options

- **SIEM Integration**: Export logs to security information systems
- **Data Analytics**: Process weekly archives with AWS Analytics services
- **Alerting**: Add CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activity patterns
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance report generation

## üìà Monitoring and Health Checks

Monitor these key metrics for solution health:

- **CloudTrail delivery status**: Ensure logs are being delivered
- **Lambda function errors**: Monitor processing failures
- **CloudWatch log ingestion**: Verify formatted logs are appearing
- **S3 storage usage**: Track archive bucket growth
- **Cost trends**: Monitor monthly spending patterns

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Implement proper IAM policies for log access
- **Encryption**: Consider enabling S3 bucket encryption
- **Network Security**: Logs include source IP addresses for analysis
- **Data Retention**: Configure appropriate retention for compliance needs
- **Audit Trail**: The solution itself creates an audit trail of its operations
